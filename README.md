# ML-algorithm-from-scratch
Machine learning algorithms are mathematical model mapping methods used to learn or uncover underlying patterns embedded in the data. Machine learning comprises a group of computational algorithms that can perform pattern recognition, classification, and prediction on data by learning from existing data. To understand the inner works of an algorithm, it is very necessary to design them from scratch. Some ML algorithms have been designed from scratch in this repository.
